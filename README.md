## Description

**FretBored** is a simple web application designed to help beginner guitarists to find and learn the guitar notes easier, by displaying an interactive interface which allows them to find any note on a 6-string guitar with 24 frets.

The app is designed to show the notes corresponding to the Standard E tuning.

## Functionality

When the user places the cursor on top of a certain fret on a string, the corresponding note is displayed as a button. By clicking on the button, the note can be played.  

## Others

I programmed the app out of my own need to find notes easily on the fretboard, therefore some details may be a bit off.

The sounds have been recorded by myself, so a few notes can sound out of tune.

Regardless, I hope someone besides myself might find the app useful.
